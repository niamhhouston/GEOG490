## Visualizing Global Urban Light Pollution Using R

#### Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a remote sensing technique that quanifies and visualizes vegetation health. It works by measuring the difference between the reflectance of near-infrared (NIR) and visiblered light. Healthy vegetation typically absorbes more visible light and reflects more NIR light, resulting in higher NDVI values. NDVIs can be particularly helpful for crop momotiring and management, identifying drought, land cover classification, ecosystem monitoring and climate change studies. An NDVI can be preformed using Rscript relatively simply using sattelite imagery. I outline the steps I took to produce my NDVI as follows.
