#### Light pollution can be understood as the excessive use of outdoor artificial light. It is an unfortunate attribute of urbanized living [4]. In addition to observed obstruction to stars and other celestial objects, light pollution has been known to affect human health, plant signaling and wildlife behavior [1,2,3]. Plants growing near artificial light sources are signaled to break buds and flower earlier in the Spring, risking the loss of their reproductive effort from late frost events [2]. For humans, light pollution can disrupt daily circadian rhythms or sleep-wake cycles which has been liked to increased health complications. [1]. Other wildlife may experience delayed signals to hibernate or migrate due to the presence from artificial light [3]. The combined aesthetic and ecological effects of light pollution provide a viable call for mitigation.
